# Rule-Induction 
LEM1 Algorithm

Requirements:

Python 2.7.12


Libraries:
Pandas
Numpy
Math


RUN DEMO:
python main.py
Enter Input File name: Input/jerzy1.txt
Enter Output file name with out extension: Output/jerzy


Notes:
Takes little longer for huge data sets.
Results for four dataset in output folder

Implementation:
All Cuttpoints Discretization
LEM1 for both single and all global covering, currently using single global covering
