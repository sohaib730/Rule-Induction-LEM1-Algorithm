# Rule-Induction LEM1 Algorithm

## Requirements:

Python 2.7.12


RUN DEMO:
python main.py

Enter Input File name: Input/jerzy1.txt

Enter Output file name with out extension: Output/jerzy


## Notes:
Tested for different data sets, just take little longer for huge data sets.

Please find results for four dataset in output folder.

## Implementation:
All Cuttpoints Discretization.

LEM1 for both single and all global covering, currently using single global covering.

Used Dropping Condition to extract rules from global covering.
